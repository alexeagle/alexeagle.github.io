# Work Experience

## Google, 11 years

| Time period          |  Perf rating  |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| 2016 Q3 – 2017 Q1    | Exceeds Expectations |
| 2017 Q3 – 2018 Q3    | Strongly Exceeds |

### Angular

Tech Lead for Angular CLI and Tooling (1.5M users).

Led DevInfra work such as syncing code changes between GitHub and Google-internal repo.

Converted Angular itself to TypeScript.

Migrated Angular to Build&Test with Bazel, along with its ecosystem (Material components, ngrx, Angular Universal). 87% reduction in Angular's CI latency.

### TypeScript

Founding member of team that implemented TypeScript as a supported language in Google. Wrote Bazel integrations, tooling for making TypeScript edits across the entire monorepo. Implemented tslint across Google's code, built into code review tool.

Wrote third-party strictness checker to build into the TypeScript compiler, https://tsetse.info. This is modelled on my very successful project Error Prone which does the same for Java.

### Google-wide continuous integration (TAP)

This is Google's CI, based on running Bazel and Remote Build Execution on a massive cluster. Led the migration of project definitions to a Maven-like format, improved team processes and testing practices.

Tech Lead for two years.

### Bazel Results UI (Sponge)

This service automatically injests event data from all Bazel executions and presents results in a GUI.
Allows more intuitive comprehension of build and test failures, troubleshooting slow builds, sharing permalink when requesting help.

Tech Lead for one year.

## Opower, 1 year

As employee #2 I got to build the UI for the company's flagship "Home energy reports" product.
This was rendered onto paper and served by the US Postal Service!
The company was later acquired by Oracle for $50M
